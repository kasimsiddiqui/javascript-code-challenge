codefellows javascript code challenge

**Awesome Index**
Create an HTML page to display the data below. It should use JS to update a
tag with id="awesome-index" with the calculated average awesome-index of all programmers, and
optionally dynamically load the data to show in the HTML. Add a little CSS, demonstrating
properties of the "box model". Your solution should continue to work even if more people are added
to the array. Write two versions, one using only vanilla JS, and one with lodash (or underscore) and
jQuery, making maximal use of those libraries. *

** Create a simple http server using node. **
This server should respond to a root-url request with a file called index.html. Do not use ExpressJS. Your code should
have error checking and at least one callback. Put five or more html elements in your index.html. One of the elements
should be a link to an external page. Things to research: node.js, callbacks, the fs module, the http module.

** Model a library using objects. **
A library contains shelves. Shelves contain books. Books have an author and a title. Include methods to add and
remove a shelf, and methods to add/remove a book. Use a modular approach so that each type of object is contained in
its own file. Add any additional functionality you think is appropriate. Create a "main" file that demonstrates the
capabilities of your library.
